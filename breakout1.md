Breakout #1 – Personalized Greeting Form
Demonstration Overview
In this breakout, you’ll build a basic interactive form that accepts a user’s name and displays a personalized greeting. This hands-on exercise helps reinforce the relationship between Entry widgets, StringVar, and event-driven functions. It’s a practical introduction to using user input in a meaningful and dynamic way.

-----------------------------------------------------

🛠️ Instructions
Build a GUI application with the following components:

1) Prompt Label
    A Label that instructs the user to enter their name (e.g., "Enter your name:").


2) Entry Field
    An Entry widget where the user types in their name.


3) Greeting Label
    A second Label that will display a personalized greeting (e.g., "Hello, Alice!"), which updates when the user clicks a button.


4) Button
    A Button labeled “Greet Me” that triggers a function to:
        - Read the input from the Entry
        - Create a greeting string
        - Update the greeting Label with the new message


-----------------------------------------------------

Bonus Challenge
After displaying the greeting, clear the Entry field so it’s ready for the next input.


Set a default greeting like “Hello, friend!” when the input is blank or on program start.


-----------------------------------------------------

✅ Example Expected Behavior:

User enters “Jordan” into the Entry field.


User clicks the “Greet Me” button.


The Label updates to: “Hello, Jordan!”


The Entry field clears automatically.
